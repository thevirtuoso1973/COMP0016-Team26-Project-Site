## User interface

Our user interface implements the design principles of _Visibility, Feedback and Affordance_. The first two are reflected by each button containing a clear symbol or a few words of explanation and the obviously interactive features in the Wellbeing Diary, Support Network and Settings (respectively). Affordance is implemented by how NudgeMe provides methods of keeping track of one’s own wellbeing and sharing it but these can be used flexibly by the user in whichever way suits them best. The UI   was praised by our testers for its simplicity. The wellbeing score circle and the step goal progress animation are 2 UI elements that we created from scratch, making the NudgeMe UI unique and memorable.

However, it could be more consistent with button colours as the buttons on the more recently implemented pages did not get changed from the default light blue colour (they should have been changed to our theme colours). If we had time, an unread symbol to indicate an unseen step goal also would have been a nice addition. Additionally, using a URL shortener for the deep link would prevent any confusion caused by the long and unfamiliar link. 

Since our application’s target group has a broad range of ages including older people who may not be as familiar with technology, it is important that the UI was simple, clear and easy to use, and I believe we did achieve this. 

Overall, we believe our UI is _good_.

## Functionality
The application we are delivering covers 100% of the MoSCow requirements. The code is readable, and the backend is easy-to-use and extendable. The application has been tested on users and the team and feedback has shown that NudgeMe fulfils the intended functionality. 

Therefore, we believe the functionality of our app is _very good_.

## Stability

## Efficiency
The performance of our map visualisation is very good.


## Compatability

Flutter supports iOS 8 and above, and API 16 and above. Throughout development, we tested the application on 2 iPhone 6's with iOS 13.6 and iOS 14.4, and 2 Android devices. Our testers also had different versions of iPhones. On all these devices, we ensured the UI and functionality were preserved. Since we did not have devices older than these and the simulators only support newer phones, we could not test on older devices than these and if we had, this would have slowed down the development process. 

Therefore, we believe NudgeMe's compatibility is _good_.
