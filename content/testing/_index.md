## User Acceptance Testing 

### Alpha testing 

Testers: 

* Naima (19 yrs, Computer Science student) 
* Vishnu (24 yrs, Software Engineer) 

Feedback from testers: 

During the development process, Naima informed us of any bugs with the step count and with her graph. She also gave feedback on the various colour changes for example with the wellbeing score circle on the home page and the change of navigation bar design.  

Vishnu gave feedback about the minute drop down button of the notification time selector being confusing as previously, the single digit numbers were not formatted with preceding 0’s (the minute options included 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. rather than 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 etc.). He expressed that it was not clear where users can scroll down and so we added a scroll bar to these pages. He also asked that we add the options to change data permissions in the Settings page, which we added after this feedback. 

### Beta testing 

Testers: 

* Vishnu (24 yrs, Software Engineer) 

* Anchal (30 yrs, Graphic Designer) 

* Manni (54 yrs, Pre-school teacher) 

Feedback from testers:  

Vishnu responded with “The home page shouldn’t be called the home page because it is not the most important page.” Additionally, he thought that in the Support Code and Postcode sections of the settings page, the current postcode/support code should be presented as hint text in the textboxes, rather than separate text. Lastly, he thought a ‘send to all’ button on the network page could be a nice addition.  

Anchal reported that she likes the bolded text on network page and the bump on the navigation bar that indicates which page is selected. She also loves the home screen as there is limited information so there is nothing confusing. She thinks seeing last week's score would encourage her to do better this week.  

Manni stated it will encourage her to do more exercise and she likes the notification aspect as she thinks it will push her to move more. However, she also thought “the caption text is too small so I could not read support code text in the introduction screen about typing selfhelp.” She found the deep link text confusing and was sightly reluctant to send and she didn’t recognise the link. In future iterations, this could be replaced with a bit.ly link. 

Feedback from Joseph, our project partner, was that on the step goal progress page, the man should be moving clockwise rather than anticlockwise (view the step goal progress [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55795994/108628127-f6197000-7450-11eb-8627-5a13b88993bd.mov)). We also considered making this change but had to prioritise some other changes first and in the end, did not have time.
