We began the UI design process by making 6 sketches on paper. These initially were pencil on paper but they have been copied onto a digital platform as the features weren’t clear. These sketches were a brainstorm of sorts, especially in terms of the placement of the menu and the ideas we had for the layouts of the home page. We evaluated these sketches and chose the best features from each to create the UI Figma. 

Below are the sketches. I am going to talk about the design principles I prioritised whilst drawing these sketches and which of these contributed to the features we decided to proceed with for the figma.

Within these sketches, I primarily focused on implementing the Design Principles of Visibility, Feedback and Mapping.  

The menu design of sketches 1, 4, 5 and maybe 6 implement Feedback as the state of each page are clear but they suffer from visibility and affordance issues. In 1, the selected page icon an icon rather than a circle, however hiding the icons of the other pages in 1 lacks visibility so we did not proceed with this idea. In 5, the page icons open a labelled window on top of the home page, which can be closed using an x and in 4, a drop-down menu opens clear text with the selected page highlighted. These are both good for feedback but emphasise the home page as significant which is not good for affordance, as it is not the most important page. 

In sketches 2, 4 and 6 maintain visibility in the sense that they keeping the number of features and the amount of text to a minimum which makes it obvious what is supposed to be done on the home page (this is a Wellbeing Checkup because at the time, we did not know that the checkup was supposed to be accessed through a notification). Sketch 3 does not contain this simplicity or visibility. The placement of the menu on these pages are ordinary and due to the simplicity of the page, it is obvious that the buttons are page menu , despite there not being a ‘Menu’ label. The menu design, however, in sketches 2 and 3 suffer from a lack of visibility and feedback, as the menu icons are identical and do not describe which page they correspond to. Therefore, regardless of which icon is selected, it is not clear which page is actually open. The icons in sketch 6 are much more descriptive. Therefore, we proceeded with simple menu placement: at the bottom of the page, and decided to use descriptive icons. 

Additionally, the slider in sketch 4 makes it very clear to the user that they must rate their wellbeing so we kept the idea of a slider, as well as the minimum number of features, text and simple menu placement. We proceeded with this slider idea, however simplified it to a rating out of 10 as these were our Moscow requirements. 

Some additional design principles we kept in mind whilst evaluating these sketches include mapping and consistency. The menu design in sketch 3 suffers from a lack of Mapping as the circular buttons feature requires the user to remember which number in the slideshow maps to each page but the vague identical nature of the menu buttons make this extremely difficult. In all these designs, the idea was to keep the menu identical on every page, in order to maintain the consistency principle.  

Here is our final Figma, that implements the most successful parts of our sketches: 

* Menu placed horizontally at the bottom of the page (from sketch 2) 

* Descriptive menu icons (from 6)

* Highlighting the icon of the selected page (from 2 and 3)

* The slider concept (from sketch 4)

Here is the UI Figma:
